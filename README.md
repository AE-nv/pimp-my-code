# pimp-my-code
For years the TA community of AE had the idea of bringing people together for "code clinics", "code quizzes" or "question of the week". Nobody took it upon him(/her) self to put things into motion. That's why I'm here. I'm here to introduce to you my fresh new program:

Once a month I will post a question / Piece of Code / Design question, which you can complete/analyse/comment.
The goal is to collect all these solutions/comments/questions and to discuss them on an evening-session at AE.

Interested? JOIN 'PIMP MY CODE' channel on the AE-BUILD teams.

Peace out, XZibit

# Format
Whenever I post a question / piece of code / design question, you can solve this at your won pace at home. 
For each new edition I will create a folder on this repository. If you want to submit your solution (and some comments in the readme), you create a subfoler named *lastname-firstname*.
